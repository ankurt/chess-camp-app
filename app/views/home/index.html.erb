  Chess Camps are the finest chess camps in the United States (<em>we concede 
  Russia can do better, but not much better</em>) and guaranteed to 
  <strong>transform your son or daughter into a tiger at the chess board</strong>.  
  The links below will tell you more about our camps, curriculums and 
  instructors and in the future will actually allow you to register your son 
  or daughter for those camps. [<%= link_to "O Happy Day!", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a37bBm8pXSk" %>]
